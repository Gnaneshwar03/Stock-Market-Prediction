The code can be divided into the following sections:

1. **Package Installation**: This section installs the necessary packages `yfinance` and imports other required packages such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `tensorflow`.

2. **Data Retrieval and Exploration**: This section downloads the historical stock data for the ticker symbol "GOOGL" from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library. It then performs some basic exploratory analysis on the data, such as checking the shape of the data, displaying the first few rows, sorting the data, removing duplicate indexes, checking for missing values, and obtaining statistical information about the data. It also visualizes the trends in the closing values and volume traded using the `plotly` library.

3. **Data Preparation**: This section prepares the data for training the model. It imports additional required packages such as `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`, `pickle`, and `tqdm`. The data is filtered to include only the "Close" and "Volume" columns. The length of the testing set is determined based on a specific date. The `CreateFeatures_and_Targets` function is defined to create input features and corresponding target values from the data. The data is split into training and testing sets. A `MultiDimensionScaler` class is defined to scale the input features, and the scaler objects are saved using `pickle` for future use. The target values are also scaled using `MinMaxScaler`.

4. **Model Building**: This section builds a deep learning model using the `tensorflow.keras` library. It imports necessary callbacks such as `ModelCheckpoint` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`. The model architecture consists of bidirectional LSTM layers, dropout layers, and dense layers. The model is compiled with a mean squared error loss function and an optimizer. The model is trained on the training data with a specified number of epochs, batch size, and validation data. The best weights are saved based on the validation loss.

5. **Visualization and Evaluation**: This section loads the best weights obtained during training. It uses the trained model to make predictions on the test set and scales the predictions and actual values back to their original scale. It creates a dataframe to compare the actual and predicted values on the test set and visualizes the results using `plotly`. It then repeats the prediction process on the entire dataset (including the training and testing sets) and visualizes the predictions on the whole data.
